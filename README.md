# simple-ga-neural-network
Simple object oriented neural network that uses a genetic algorithm to train. Note that this is incredibly inneficient and is meant to show the cencepts of a neural network. Implementation of a usable GANN would require extensive rewrite and optimization to make use of arrays and array operatins rather than this approach.
