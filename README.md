# simple-ga-neural-network
Simple object oriented neural network that uses a genetic algorithm to train. Note that this is incredibly inefficient and is meant to show the concepts of a neural network. Implementation of a usable GANN would require extensive rewrite and optimization to make use of arrays and array operations rather than this approach.
